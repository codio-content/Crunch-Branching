Write a program that does the following

1. Get a number from a DAT memory location called 'Number' (do not use an INP statement and `Number` is case sensitive). You should set this to different values as you test the scenarios below.
1. If the number is less than or equal to 10, output `0`.
1. If the number is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20, output `1`.
1. If the number is greater than 20 and less than or equal to 30, output `2`.
1. If the number is greater than 30, output `99`.

**Important:** your code should only output a single value.

When you're done, press the button below.
