Branching can be bit of a brain cruncher the first time you see it. It should seem quite simple with a bit of practice.

## Play
Now's a good time to play around with the sample code on the left 

### Change X
You should change the value of X to different values and then step through the code again.

As we are comparing to `20`, try a different value for `X` above and below `20` as well as `20` itself.

### Change BGT
You can also change the `BGT` instruction to one of the other branch operators, like `BEQ`, `BLT` and so on.

Just experiment to help you understand it thoroughly.
