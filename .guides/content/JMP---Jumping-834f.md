The `JMP` instruction is very useful for jumping to a marked location in the code.

Consider the following example that's a variation on the last example we looked at.

> Get a number between 0 and 10 from a `DAT` memory location `Number`. Multiply the input number by 10 and display it. 
>
> If the number is larger than 10 then display 'Input error' in the display console.
