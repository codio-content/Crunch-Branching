This should not require any hints. It will require multiple branch locations, though.

|||challenge
Write some code that 

1. Inputs from a `DAT` variable called `Number` (case-sensitive).
1. If `Number` is between 1 and 10 or between 90 and 100 then output 1 otherwise output 0.
1. Once you have output 1 or 0, output 99 to finish off with. This will require a `JMP` instruction.

When you're done, press the button below.
