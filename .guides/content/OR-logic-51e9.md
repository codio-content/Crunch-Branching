And here is how conditional 'OR' logic is handled.

Take a look at the code on the left and make sure you can see what is going on. 

Our scenario is

> Enter a number and if the entered number is 1, 10 or 100 then output `1`, otherwise output `0`.

This could be represented by the following pseudo-code.

```python
input(Number)
if Number == 1 OR Number == 10 OR Number == 100
  output(1)
else
  output(0)
```
